The inspiration for the icons came from lokaltog (https://github.com/Lokaltog) and his post in the dwm hackers thread 
(https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=724236#p724236) on the Arch Linux Forums. Many of the icons are his or based on his. Also thanks to sm4tik, Thayer, 
and Rob for the icon packs they made for dzen2 (http://dzen.geekmode.org/dwiki/doku.php?id=dzen:icon-packs). And much thanks to sunaku 
(https://github.com/sunaku) for suggesting to use the Unicode Private Use area (U+E000 - U+F8FF) and for figuring out how to use it.

This font only contains icons that can be used in status bars, etc. The way it works in dwm (http://dwm.suckless.org) is that two fonts are defined in config.h. 
For example, (static const char font[] = "-*-stlarch-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" "," "-*-terminus-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";). It will use terminus for 
the text and stlarch_font for the icons. From a terminal, you can do something like (#echo -e '\uE015') and copy the output to a script. In this example, it will 
display a clock icon. It may show up as a block in urxvt but go ahead and copy it and it should display the correct glyph. You can view and modify the font with gbdfed 
(http://sofia.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/gbdfed/). You'll need bdftopcf and pcf2bdf. First, convert the .pcf file to .bdf (#pcf2bdf -o stlarch.bdf stlarch.pcf). 
Next, open the bdf file with gbdfed and edit to suit. Then, convert it back to .pcf (#bdftopcf -o stlarch.pcf stlarch.bdf) and reinstall it.

To install manually, copy stlarch.pcf to /usr/share/fonts/local.
$fc-cache -f
$mkfontscale /usr/share/fonts/local
$mkfontdir /usr/share/fonts/local

Add this to your .xinitrc if you don't have it already:
xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/local
xset fp rehash
